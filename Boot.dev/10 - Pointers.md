# Introduction to Pointers

As we have learned, a variable is a named location in memory that stores a value. We can manipulate the value of a variable by assigning a new value to it or by performing operations on it. When we assign a value to a variable, we are storing that value in a specific location in memory.

```go
x := 42
// "x" is the name of a location in memory. That location is storing the integer value of 42
```

## A Pointer Is a Variable

A pointer is a variable that stores the _memory address_ of another variable. This means that a pointer "points to" the _location_ of where the data is stored, **_not_** the actual data itself.

The `*` syntax defines a pointer:

```go
var p *int
```

The `&` operator generates a pointer to its operand.

```go
myString := "hello"
myStringPtr := &myString
```
